# KiCAD pretty PCB footprints

<p>Footprints generated from dimensions on manufacturer spec sheets. 
<p>The MSP430s have thermal pads that should be connected to the ground layer of the PCB. If thermal relief has been set in the ground layer pour, the clearance may be too large to connect the layer to the small plated through-holes. Set the pad connection to solid in the local clearance settings.
